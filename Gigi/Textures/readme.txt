====================================
FAST_Binomial3x3_Exp, FAST_Blue_Exp, FAST_Blue2D, FAST_Box3x3_Exp, FAST_Tent_Blue_Exp
These were made by the FAST optimizer and are all 128x128x32
https://github.com/electronicarts/fastnoise

FAST_Tent_Blue_Exp made with these command lines:
FastNoise.exe real Tent Gauss 1.0 exponential 0.1 0.1 product 128 128 32 FAST_Tent_Blue_Exp/real_tent_gauss1_0_exp0101_product -split
FastNoise.exe real Tent Gauss 1.0 exponential 0.1 0.1 separate 0.5 128 128 32 FAST_Tent_Blue_Exp/real_tent_gauss1_0_exp0101_separate05 -split

All others were found premade in noise.zip

====================================
STBN_10 and STBN_19 are "spatiotemporal blue noise" textures, made with a sigma of 1.0 and 1.9 respectively, and are both 128x128x32
